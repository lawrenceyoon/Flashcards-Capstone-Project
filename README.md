# Flashcards Project

## Context

A React project that reaches into a backend JSON API server to retrieve information on decks and cards. You can CREATE decks/cards, READ information on decks/cards, UPDATE cards, and DELETE decks/cards.

## Intention

- A full-stack application designed to test on us the front-end portion. This capstone had the backend built for us from Thinkful's course. Our task was to connect and make API calls using useEffect hooks to properly retrieve and show data on our frontend. We then stored the retrieved back-end information in state. Overall, this full-stack project was a great example of working with an existing codebase, while showcasing our front-end abilities.
- The tools we needed to use: useState, useEffect hooks, props, and react router.

## Functionality (photos)

## Discoveries

Discovered how react-router works in a full-stack application. We needed to nest routers, so a parent component wouldn't be overloaded with Switch or Links. This was more difficult than I imagined; every button or link click needed to rerender a different component with the proper url.

## Future goals

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, ReactJS (Hooks), NodeJS
